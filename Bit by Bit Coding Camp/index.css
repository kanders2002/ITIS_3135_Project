/* First, I have the body for the entire base of the page. In the body, I set the background color and font family. I also
used text align in order to center all of the information on the page.*/

/*As reference, I learned from W3Schools how to create a navigation bar (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp).
For ul, I used list-style-type, margin, padding, overflow, and background-color. list-style-type was used in order to hide the
bullet points from appearing on the page. Setting the margin to 0 sets the navigation bar to the top of the page, rather than
there being an awkward barrier. Padding does a similar thing, but sets the pieces of the list to the left of the page (since
there is 0 padding). Overflow being hidden stops the navigation bar from being awkwardly mixed into the header.*/

ul {
    list-style-type: none;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    background-color: #282622;

/*In li, all this simply does is change the list from being viewed as vertical to horizontal. In li a, we are editing the
actual page boxes (the list). The display provides more space, due to the block element. In order to create more space for
each individual piece listed, using padding's width and height. By using text decoration, I am able to eliminate the underline
on the text which is caused due to it being a link to a page.*/

li {
  float: left;

li a {
    display: block;
    font-size: 18px;

/*Current is the class which I used for Home in HTML. For Home, I am simply changing the background color and making the font
bold in order to specify to the user what page they are on.*/

/*In h1, I am editing the header for the page. In the header, the two most important pieces are margin-top and padding.
The margin-top is used to get rid of funny spacing between the navigation bar and header. The padding I have used in order
to make the header longer in order for aesthetic purposes. The rest is just selecting the background color, font color, size,
and centering text.*/

/*The welcome section is the welcome paragraph. In the welcome paragraph, I have created a border in order to make a cute
little box. I set the width of the box in order to make the paragraph box smaller. However, when changing the width, it
affected the margin of the box. So, in order to fix the box to sit in the center instead of the left, I set the margin to
auto. I also used line-height in order to make the paragraph easier to read for users.*/

/*I simply gave the images a border, as well as a bottom margin in order to make the page cleaner. I wanted a cute little line
between the images and information, so I created the hr tag for a line. All I simply did was specify the line's color, size,
