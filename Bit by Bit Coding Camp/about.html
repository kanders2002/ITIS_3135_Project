<!--First, in the body, I have the list for the navigation. Since this is the About Page, I have the class as current (which
will become important in CSS). Each of these are linked to the four pages. Next, I have the header which says About Page. After
that, I have a detail paragraph about the camp. I have used jQuery-UI Widget known as tabs. I have used the tabs in order to
separate the camp information into their own individual sections. Next, I have a section of the programming languages with three
images of the language logos. Lastly, I have my footer.-->

        <p><strong>Details:</strong><br> Bit by Bit Coding Camp was created by high school 2020 senior Katie Anders. Katie wanted to reach out to students and introduce them to Computer Science. Quite often, in the STEM field, Computer Science
        is deemed less important than Science, Engineering, and Mathematics. Through this camp, Katie hopes to introduce students to the Computer Science field and all it has to offer. Not only that but, in order to reach
        and introduce as many students as possible, the camp is completely free.</p>
