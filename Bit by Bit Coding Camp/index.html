<!--First, in the body, I have the list for the navigation. Since this is the Home Page, I have the class as current (which
will become important in CSS). Each of these are linked to the four pages. Next, I have the header which says Bit by Bit Coding
Camp. After that, I have an introduction paragraph about the camp. Next, I have three images of the camp. After the images, I
then have the camp information. I have the title of the paragraphs in bold font and have used breaks for aesthetic purposes.
Lastly, I have my footer.-->
