<!--First, in the body, I have the list for the navigation. Since this is the Application Page, I have the class as current
(which will become important in CSS). Each of these are linked to the four pages. Next, I have the header which says Application
Page. After that, I have a confirmation of the form being submitted. Since this is just an add on to the application, I have
just used the application files above. Lastly, I have my footer.-->
